            <p className="tagline">
              ORBITEX is an independent, research-grade space intelligence dashboard.
              Every number is either fetched live from a named, credible source or
              computed from a documented, verifiable formula. Nothing is invented,
              and unverifiable values are labeled as estimates.

            <h2>The core promise</h2>
            <p>
              If a figure cannot be traced to a source or a formula, it does not appear
              on ORBITEX. If a source is temporarily unreachable, the page shows the most
              recent verified reading with its timestamp, rather than a blank space or an
              invented value.
            </p>
            <p>
              ORBITEX is not affiliated with NASA, NOAA, ESA, or any space agency. It
              aggregates publicly available data for education and research.

            <h2>How positions are computed</h2>
            <ul className="feature-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Planets:</strong> positions use JPL Keplerian elements for the
                eight major planets, valid through 2050 AD. Distances are derived from the
                heliocentric ecliptic vectors.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Satellites:</strong> the ISS and catalog groups are propagated from
                NORAD element sets using a Kepler orbit solver with J2 secular perturbations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Deep-space probes:</strong> positions are queried from JPL Horizons.
                When a live position is unavailable, ORBITEX extrapolates from the probe's
                last known state using documented orbital mechanics, and labels the result
                as an estimate.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Moon:</strong> lunar phase and illumination use a standard
                ecliptic-longitude theory derived from the Moon's mean longitude and the
                Sun's position.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <div className="glass glass-card scaffold-card" style={{ marginTop: 24 }}>
            <h2>Freshness & accuracy</h2>
            <p>
              Each dataset is refreshed on a schedule matched to how quickly it changes:
              solar wind and geomagnetic readings every few minutes, asteroid approaches
              and launch schedules throughout the day, and the news deck daily. Every figure
              carries a timestamp, so you can always see when the most recent verified
              reading was taken.
